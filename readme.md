## What is Machine Learning ?

<p>
  <b>Machine learning</b> is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
</p>
<p>
The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
</p>

## Types of Machine Learning

<p>
  <b>Supervised machine learning algorithms</b> can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, <b>unsupervised machine learning algorithms</b> are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms</b> fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise, acquiring unlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Reinforcement machine learning algorithms</b> is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.
</p>

## 2. Regression (Supervised Learning)
<p>
Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables. More specifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It predicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc.
</p>
<p>
Regression is a supervised learning technique which helps in finding the correlation between variables and enables us to predict the continuous output variable based on the one 
or more predictor variables. It is mainly used for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal-effect relationship between variables.
</p>
<p>  In Regression, we plot a graph between the variables which best fits the given datapoints, using this plot, the machine learning model can make predictions about the data. In simple words, "Regression shows a line or curve that passes through all the datapoints on target-predictor graph in such a way that the vertical distance between the datapoints and the regression line is minimum." The distance between datapoints and line tells whether a model has captured a strong relationship or not.
</p>
<p>
<b>Some examples of regression can be as: Prediction of rain using temperature and other factors, Determining Market trends, Prediction of road accidents due to rash driving.</b>

## 3. Classification (Supervised Learning)

<p><b>The Classification algorithm</b> is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories.</p>
<p>Unlike regression, the output variable of Classification is a category, not a value, such as "Green or Blue", "fruit or animal", etc. Since the Classification algorithm is a Supervised learning technique, hence it takes labeled input data, which means it contains input with the corresponding output.</p>
<p>In classification algorithm, a discrete output function(y) is mapped to input variable(x).</p>
<p>The best example of an ML classification algorithm is <b>Email Spam Detector.</b></p>
<p>The main goal of the Classification algorithm is to identify the category of a given dataset, and these algorithms are mainly used to predict the output for the categorical data.</p>
<p>Classification algorithms can be better understood using the below diagram. In the below diagram, there are two classes, class A and Class B. These classes have features that are similar to each other and dissimilar to other classes.</p>

## 4. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

<p><b>Clustering</b> or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."</p>
<p>t does it by finding some similar patterns in the unlabelled dataset such as shape, size, color, behavior, etc., and divides them as per the presence and absence of those similar patterns.</p>
<p>It is an unsupervised learning
method, hence no supervision is provided to the algorithm, and it deals with the unlabeled dataset.</p>
<p>After applying this clustering technique, each cluster or group is provided with a cluster-ID. ML system can use this id to simplify the processing of large and complex datasets.</p>
<p>The clustering technique can be widely used in various tasks. Some most common uses of this technique are:
<b>
Market Segmentation,
Statistical data analysis,
Social network analysis,
Image segmentation,
Anomaly detection, etc.
</b>

## 8. Deep Learning
<p>
  <b>Deep learning</b> (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
</p>
<p>
  Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.
</p>
<p>
  Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analogue.
</p>
<p>
  The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability, whence the "structured" part.
</p>

### 8 a. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ✅ [Google Colab File Available here](https://github.com/lionelsamrat10/machine-learning-a-to-z/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Artificial%20Neural%20Network%20(ANN)/ANN%20For%20Classification/artificial_neural_network_for_classification_samrat.ipynb)

<p>
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming.
</p>
<p>
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.
</p>
<p>
Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.
</p>
<p>
The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.
</p>
<p>
Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, playing "Go" ).
